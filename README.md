# Intelligent Daily Route Planner

An advanced route planning system that uses machine learning and real-time traffic data to optimize travel routes.

## Features

- Advanced pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra's)
- Real-time traffic prediction
- Dynamic route optimization
- User preference handling
- High-performance geographic calculations

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Dependencies listed in requirements.txt

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the API server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn api.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Make a route request:
   ```python
   POST /route
   {
     "start": {"latitude": 40.7128, "longitude": -74.0060},
     "end": {"latitude": 40.7614, "longitude": -73.9776},
     "departure_time": "2023-09-20T08:30:00Z",
     "user_id": "user123",
     "preferences": {"avoid_highways": true}
   }
   ```

## Architecture

- FastAPI for REST API
- NetworkX for graph operations
- Scikit-learn for traffic prediction
- Redis for caching
- SQLAlchemy for data persistence

## Performance Features

- Efficient pathfinding algorithms
- Caching of frequent routes
- Batch processing of traffic updates
- Asynchronous API endpoints
